// Write a for loop that counts down from 10 to 1 .


// Iterate through an array of numbers [1, 5, 8, 10, 15]. Stop the loop completely when you find a number greater than 9.


// Iterate 1 to 10. Use continue to skip printing the number 5 .


// Write a while loop that keeps generating a random number (mock with variable) until it gets a 5 .


// Write a do-while loop that runs at least once even if the condition is false initially .


// Loop through the string "JavaScript" and log each character .


// Iterate over {a: 1, b: 2} and log "Key: a, Value: 1" etc. .


// Use forEach to calculate the sum of an array [10, 20, 30] .


// Write a while loop that would crash the browser (infinite) and then comment out the line that causes the infinite behavior (e.g., missing increment).


// Use a nested for loop to print a coordinate grid (0,0), (0,1)... (2,2).
